- If you are a CS major or minor, please activate your account according to [these](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/compfac/user-accounts) instructions.

- The university offers its students two ways for wireless internet connection: Eduroam and HUPnet. You can also get guest access to HUPnet. HUPnet is not secured, so we heavily recommend using Eduroam. You can also access it in some campus sites overseas. Instructions on installing Eduroam are found [here](https://helpdesk.it.helsinki.fi/en/instructions/logging-and-connections/networks/setting-eduroam-installer-package). You can also install it on your mobile device: [Android](https://helpdesk.it.helsinki.fi/en/instructions/computer-and-printing/mobile-devices/eduroam-on-android-devices) and [iPhone](https://helpdesk.it.helsinki.fi/en/instructions/computer-and-printing/mobile-devices/ipad-and-iphone-wireless-connections).

- The CS departmens offers several servers for accessing your personal university AD home folder. You can access these via SSH if you have a CS department account (see link in first bullet):

  - melkki.cs.helsinki.fi
  - melkinpaasi.cs.helsinki.fi
  - shell.cs.helsinki.fi
  - melkinkari.cs.helsinki.fi


<div class="warning">
If you use the department's servers over SSH connection and have added your private key to an SSH-agent, according to university regulations you have to secure the private key with a password.
</div>

- In addition to the AD home folder, you get a CS home folder located in `/cs/home/<käyttäjätunnus>`, accessible from the departments systems. You can publish your own home page to https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/your_account_name by creating an HTML file to `/cs/home/tunnus/public_html/index.html`.

- The departments also has a cluster called [Ukko](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/compfac/high-performance-cluster-ukko).

- Do not run sudo commands in the CS department's systems. Such behaviour is logged as malicious.
